### 🌀 About LeakerEngine

**LeakerEngine** is a fork of [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine), built to **improve performance**, **add new features**, and **enhance customization**.  
It keeps the original modding spirit while offering **smoother gameplay**, **better tools**, and **more creative freedom** for Friday Night Funkin’ mods.

## 🧩 Installation

See the [Build Instructions](docs/BUILDING.md) to compile and run the engine.

## ⚙️ Customization

You can easily toggle engine features (like *Lua Scripts* or *Video Cutscenes*) inside the `Project.xml` file.

To disable a feature:
```
<!-- Example: disable video cutscenes -->
<!-- <define name="VIDEOS_ALLOWED" /> -->
```

Same goes for `LUA_ALLOWED` and other optional components.
