### üåÄ About Aetherion Engine

**Aetherion Engine** is a fork of [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine), built to **improve performance**, **add new features**, and **enhance customization**.  
It keeps the original modding spirit while offering **smoother gameplay**, **better tools**, and **more creative freedom** for Friday Night Funkin‚Äô mods.

To disable a feature:
